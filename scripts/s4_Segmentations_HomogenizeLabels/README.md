These files were cerated during investigation of the labels present in each segmentation output to
1) generate a look-up table to homogenize labels across all tools.
2) allow for giving names to labels (for visualization purposes)
3) allow for FreeSurfer congruent coloring

Access to all these tools was later included in `utils.py`
